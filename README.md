## Human Pose Estimation Model Comparison Framework (hpe_model_comparison.py)

A comprehensive framework for comparing different Human Pose Estimation (HPE) models and analyzing their impact on downstream tasks in multimodal processing pipelines.

## Overview

This framework allows researchers and developers to:

- Compare different HPE models (ViTPose, OpenPose, HRNet, DEKR)
- Analyze feature importance in pose-to-parsing pipelines
- Visualize the impact of text prompts on multimodal processing
- Generate comparative visualizations for model performance analysis

## Key Components

### HPE Model Wrappers
- Abstract interface for pose estimation models
- Implementations for popular HPE architectures
- Integration with pre-trained models from Hugging Face

### Feature Importance Visualization
- Occlusion-based importance analysis
- Integrated gradients for feature attribution
- Token importance visualization for text prompts
- Cross-model comparison capabilities

### Model Integration
- CLIP text encoder integration
- Dummy pose-to-parsing pipeline for demonstration
- Extensible architecture for custom model integration

## Example Usage

```python
image_path = "path/to/your/image.jpg"
text_prompt = "Wearing a white shirt with green, red stripes, the number 7 in green and white shorts with the number 7 in green"

analyze_hpe_models(image_path, text_prompt)
